    "Two versions of a wordgame have to be implemented in the following Problem Set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game is a lot like Scrabble or \"words with friends\": Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each valid word receives a score, based on the lenght of the word and the letters in that word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rules of the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dealing**\n",
    "- A player is dealt a hand of n letters chosen at random (assume n=7 for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The player arranges the hand into as many words as they want out of the letters, using each letter at most once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some letters may remain unused (these won't be scored).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring**\n",
    "- Score is the sum of the scores for each word formed. \n",
    "- The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on the first word created.\n",
    "- Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.\n",
    "- For example, 'weed' would be worth 32 points ((4+1+1+2) for the four letters, then multiply by len('weed') to get (4+1+1+2)*4 = 32). Be sure to check that the hand actually has 1 'w', 2 'e's, and 1 'd' before scoring the word!\n",
    "- As another example, if n=7 and you make the word 'waybill' on the first try, it would be worth 155 points (the base score for 'waybill' is (4+1+4+3+1+1+1)*7=105, plus an additional 50 point bonus for using all n letters)."
